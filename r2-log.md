# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 5: October 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- learned a little about how Next.js works
- setup both frontend and backend with dependencies for imsilentphotography
  - build process runs fine with no hassle
- dove into WP REST API, jesus CHRIST this isn't scary at all, given that i've worked with most of this data before via normal WordPress

**Thoughts:**

- today was... also pretty laid back tbh. but the deeper i get into WP the more excited i get about it for some reason

## Day 4: October 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- got started with headless WordPress
  - gonna be trying out WP REST API with both Gatsby and NextJS
- started migrating imsilentphotography.net to WP/NextJS

**Thoughts:**

- today was kind of laid back, didn't do a lot as far as coding but did do a fair amount of researching

## Day 3: October 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- blasted through nodeschool's `stream-adventure`!
- getting intimate with tree traversal, able to construct trees without a hitch, depth-first traversal could use some more grokking though
- attempted to help a peer out with the HTML Drag & Drop API, but the solution they were looking for wasn't possible due to browser constraints
- (today isn't over at the time of writing this, but it's late so meh) plan on diving into RxJS and headless WordPress today

**Thoughts:**

- backend programming is really neat, i like the _programming logic_ aspect of it a lot more than frontend, but i do like frontend overall more because of the artistic aspect

## Day 2: September 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- finished the full design for a client site!
- decided to dial down on backend programming, will be touring Meteor, Express, etc. and blogging about it on [Try Coding It's Fun](https://trycodingitsfun.com) along with my experiences in Django

**Thoughts:**

- (i guess i didn't really code so much today, but design still counts towards a website i'm building so i'll call it coding)

**Link to work:** (it's private, sry)

## Day 1: September 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- finished the homepage design, full portfolio page design for a client site
- went to [NodeSchool SF](https://twitter.com/nodeschoolsf) and finished [learnyounode](https://www.github.com/workshopper/learnyounode)

**Thoughts:**

- web design is cool, but it's kind of dense and i can't do it for super long periods at a time
- diving deeper and deeper into backend, glad i could get some work done in Node as i take a break from Meteor to focus on this client site i'm working on
- **i want to get into computer graphics for sure**
