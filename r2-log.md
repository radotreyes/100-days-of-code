# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 18: October 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- the data layer for imsilentphotography is completely linked to the frontend now
- have custom post types and featured image access working
- learned quite a bit about Next.js architecture lol. aka don't mess with the App component
- all the data i need is exposed via REST API now. will look into ACFs and see if i need to add anything else.

**Thoughts:**

- happy with how i handled my debugging process today. even though it wasn't smooth as i'd like, i still came to my senses, didn't tunnel on one particular hunch, and actually figured out my problems in a timely fashion
  - just need practice!
- tomorrow: see what improvements can be made to the server/db layers, then start diving into my layout!

## Day 17: October 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- have custom menus and post types working for imsilentphotography
- moved menus over to context API with SSR
- layout is coming along, will get deep into styling tomorrow after fully configuring CPTs and ACF

**Thoughts:**

- my debugging process needs to change. i plan on reading Clean Code daily. i feel as if i get stuck on simple problems too easily because i hang on to my incorrect assumptions for too long...
- site is coming along nicely after a few delays due to an interview (didn't get the job, but good experience)

## Day 11: October 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- through the first 9.5/29 sections of colt steele DS&A
- solved a butt ton of algorithms, including frequency counters, sliding doors, recursion

**Thoughts:**

- it's just interview experience man CHILL!!!!
- this course is maybe 75% review, 25% new stuff so far

## Day 8: October 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**:i

- spent all day working on a little fun project
  - uses CSS grid to generate and populate tile maps, could be used for various 2D games
  - all in vanilla JS (besides the express dev server)
  - having issues updating the entities on the generated grid map

**Thoughts:**

- that project started out as a fun idea and got convoluted really quickly lol
- i'm glad i started it though, it's nice to be working on games again

## Day 7: October 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- working with SSR in Next.js and learning when and how to utilize SSR methods when loading API queries with WordPress
  - built a useful, dynamic `Archive` component which loads reliably loads any CPT or taxonomy data when passing them in as args
- used Sass to define my grid and flex layouts for the index page

**Thoughts:**

- Sass is actually really really really fun and i really enjoy it
- working through the gotchas of Next.js + WP is what it seems like i'm doing a lot of right now, i'm not mad at it tbh
  - actually i'm excited to finally be able to build sites in WP!
  - i have a pretty strong command over React and Next (and Sass tbh, not a strong command but a decent grasp of it), and i don't think i will be running into too many problems with migrating this site

## Day 5: October 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- learned a little about how Next.js works
- setup both frontend and backend with dependencies for imsilentphotography
  - build process runs fine with no hassle
- dove into WP REST API, jesus CHRIST this isn't scary at all, given that i've worked with most of this data before via normal WordPress

**Thoughts:**

- today was... also pretty laid back tbh. but the deeper i get into WP the more excited i get about it for some reason

## Day 4: October 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- got started with headless WordPress
  - gonna be trying out WP REST API with both Gatsby and NextJS
- started migrating imsilentphotography.net to WP/NextJS

**Thoughts:**

- today was kind of laid back, didn't do a lot as far as coding but did do a fair amount of researching

## Day 3: October 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- blasted through nodeschool's `stream-adventure`!
- getting intimate with tree traversal, able to construct trees without a hitch, depth-first traversal could use some more grokking though
- attempted to help a peer out with the HTML Drag & Drop API, but the solution they were looking for wasn't possible due to browser constraints
- (today isn't over at the time of writing this, but it's late so meh) plan on diving into RxJS and headless WordPress today

**Thoughts:**

- backend programming is really neat, i like the _programming logic_ aspect of it a lot more than frontend, but i do like frontend overall more because of the artistic aspect

## Day 2: September 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- finished the full design for a client site!
- decided to dial down on backend programming, will be touring Meteor, Express, etc. and blogging about it on [Try Coding It's Fun](https://trycodingitsfun.com) along with my experiences in Django

**Thoughts:**

- (i guess i didn't really code so much today, but design still counts towards a website i'm building so i'll call it coding)

**Link to work:** (it's private, sry)

## Day 1: September 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**:

- finished the homepage design, full portfolio page design for a client site
- went to [NodeSchool SF](https://twitter.com/nodeschoolsf) and finished [learnyounode](https://www.github.com/workshopper/learnyounode)

**Thoughts:**

- web design is cool, but it's kind of dense and i can't do it for super long periods at a time
- diving deeper and deeper into backend, glad i could get some work done in Node as i take a break from Meteor to focus on this client site i'm working on
- **i want to get into computer graphics for sure**
