# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: September 30, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**:

- finished the full design for a client site!
- decided to dial down on backend programming, will be touring Meteor, Express, etc. and blogging about it on [Try Coding It's Fun](https://trycodingitsfun.com) along with my experiences in Django

**Thoughts:**

- (i guess i didn't really code so much today, but design still counts towards a website i'm building so i'll call it coding)

**Link to work:** (it's private, sry)

### Day 1: September 29, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**:

- finished the homepage design, full portfolio page design for a client site
- went to [NodeSchool SF](https://twitter.com/nodeschoolsf) and finished [learnyounode](https://www.github.com/workshopper/learnyounode)

**Thoughts:**

- web design is cool, but it's kind of dense and i can't do it for super long periods at a time
- diving deeper and deeper into backend, glad i could get some work done in Node as i take a break from Meteor to focus on this client site i'm working on
- **i want to get into computer graphics for sure**
